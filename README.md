# my-infosec-handbook

Hi! I'm Brandon and I'm a 25-year-old IT Professional. I am going to be an InfoSec Professional.

Based on the knowledge I possess at this date, I find it hard to believe anyone will ever read this. If I stick to these goals over time, maybe this could become a resource for others who also find themselves in the position I am in today.

A few weeks ago, I bought a little pocket notebook to collect and organize my thoughts as I traverse my studies in cyberspace and it's been working really well. A friend convinced me that I should transcribe my notebook into a github repo so I will make updates as I fill out the pages of my book. 

I feel excited thinking about what this repo could become over time, but for now, I will return to my studies.
